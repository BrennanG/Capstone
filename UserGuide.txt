In our current system, there are 2 different types of accounts: Students and Teachers.

Each Student's home page lists all of his/her documents, enrolled classes, and assignments.
There are also forms that allow the student to create new documents and submit documents to assignments.
Clicking a document opens it in the graphing portal, which allows the student to edit the graph.
The Student has the ability add, remove, move, and add labels to both nodes and edges.
There are also undo/redo functions and a save button.

Each Teacher's home page lists all of his/her classes and has a form to create new classes.
Clicking on a class in the list opens up that class's page, which lists the Teacher, enrolled Students, and assignments.
From this page, the Teacher can add students and assignments to the class.
Clicking on a specific assignment brings up that assignment's page which lists all documents that have been submitted by Students.
The Teacher can click on any of the submitted documents to view them.
