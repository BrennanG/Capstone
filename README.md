# Capstone
Students in introductory biology courses must demonstrate their understanding of biological systems by developing graphical models of such systems (e.g., food chains, signaling pathways, metabolic networks). This web-based system will support studentsâ€™ creation and revision of such diagrams, will support the course staff in reviewing the diagrams and providing embedded feedback, and will provide analytics that might support educational research.
